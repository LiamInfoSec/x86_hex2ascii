# x86_hex2ascii
I got tired of copying and pasting 0x.. to ascii converters and then realizing that I needed to swap all the bytes to little endian. 

So i created this Bash script. 


This also works with multiple inputs:
```
root@kali:~# ./hex2ascii 0x6e69622f 0x68732f2f
/bin//sh
root@kali:~#
```
